# Regex_Task
## Pythonistas Task two

## Task
Using regular expressions, complete the functions in `number_search.py` to capture
1. numbers in text file `article.txt` (whole and decimal)
2. latex format of fractions (mixed and proper) i.e `\\frac{1}{1} = 1/2` or `2\\tinyfrac{1}{2} = 2 1/2`
3. only match numbers or fractions that end with `space(" ")`,  `fullstop(.)` `comma(,) `or `newline(\n)`
4. make sure all test have passed in pytest

## How to do
*   fork the repo and update number_search.py file
*   run `pytest` on terminal to see if function works
*   send a pull request when done to get graded


## Note:
*   Make sure to add directory to your `PYTHONPATH` to avoid `module import error`
*   Do not edit `article.txt` and `test_regex.py`
